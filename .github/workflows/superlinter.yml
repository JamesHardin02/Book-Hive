# PR = Pull Request

on:
  # Run the quality gate on every PR into main (most important trigger).

    branches:

  # Also run on pushes to main (keeps main clean if pushed directly).

# Avoid wasting minutes on stale runs
concurrency:
  # The "concurrency group" is like a traffic-lane name.
  # Any workflow runs with the SAME group are mutually exclusive:
  #  - only 1 run executes at a time, and
  #  - if a new run starts, the old one gets canceled (cancel-in-progress: true)
  #
  # github.ref is the git reference for what triggered the run:
  #  - pushes look like:    refs/heads/main, refs/head/feature/foo
  #  - PRs often look like: refs/pull/<id>/merge
  #
  # Result:
  #  - pushing multiple commits quickly to the same branch cancels older runs for that branch
  #  - other branches/PRs still run in parallel (different group values)

      # ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      # FUTURE DEVELOPMENT (when real code arrives)
      #
      # 1) Add targeted linters/formatters:
      #    - Backend (Python/FastAPI): ruff + pytest
      #    - Frontend (Vue): eslint + prettier + unit tests
      #
      # 2) Add dedicated test jobs (recommended once /backend and /frontend exists):
      #
      # jobs:
      #   backend-tests:
      #     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      #     steps:
      #       - checkout
      #       - setup-python (choose a pinned Python version)
      #       - install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
      #       - run ruff (lint/format check)
      #       - run pytest (unit tests)
      #
      #   frontend-tests:
      #     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      #     steps:
      #       - checkout
      #       - setup-node (choose pinned Node version)
      #       - npm ci
      #       - npm run lint
      #       - npm test
      #
      # 3) Add a build job (optional until ready to demo/deploy):
      #    - build frontend (npm run build)
      #    - build backend artifact (optional)
      #    - upload artifacts so you can download build outputs from the run
      #
      #   build:
      #     needs: [backend-tests, frontend-tests]
      #     steps:
      #       - checkout
      #       - build steps...
      #       - upload-artifact
      #
      # CD (auto-deploy) is intentionally postponed until the deployment target is decided.
